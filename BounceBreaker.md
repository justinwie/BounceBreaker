# BounceBreaker

BounceBreaker is a twist on the classic game, BrickBreaker, where the user tries to hit the bricks appearing on the top of the screen at the beginning of each level, before the bricks reach the bottom. Each brick has a power number representing how many times it must be hit to be destroyed, incrementing by one at each higher level. The user's ball power number increases as well.

MVP List:
- Blocks reach the bottom of the screen and each block has a power number
- User's ball has multiple trailing balls representing its power number
- Green balls appear so that users can increase their power number
- User's ball collides with the bricks in an intuitive way

My game will use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML Canvas. Technical challenges include rendering a fluid, responsive game - specifically the animations with the user's chained trailing ball. Another technical challenge will be rendering the collision of the ball against the bricks. This will be accomplished by using HTML5 Canvas/JS code.

Implementation Timeline
Phase I:
- Create the pieces for the game including the bricks, user ball, and green balls.
- Keep track of the brick's / user's power numbers
- Incorporate the collision algorithms

Phase II:
- Finish the logic for the game
- Create a rough playable version of the game

Phase III:
- Polish the game to have a smooth user experience
